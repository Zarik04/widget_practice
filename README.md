# widget_practice
This repo is for a mobile programming course homework 2!
I have created two widgets one is stateless and another one is stateful. Both of them are in main.dart file.
These two widgets can satisfy all the requirements of the homework both widget tree and styling requirements.
Before, running this code you should uncomment one of the runApp functions inside a main function.
DO NOT REMOVE COMMENTS FROM BOTH OF runApp FUNCTIONS!
