*This repo is for a mobile programming course homework 2!*
I have created two widgets one is stateless and another one is stateful. Both of them are in main.dart file.
These two widgets can satisfy all the requirements of the homework both widget tree and styling requirements.

**To run this program**, you should do:
1. Create an empty flutter project in either android studio or another editor that can create an flutter project.
2. Replace the default code in main.dart with the code in main.dart from this repo.
3. Configure the run properties and choose a mobile device to run this code.
4. Remove comments from one of the code blocks inside main function. (Only one of the code blocks)

**Pay attention!**
Before, running this code you should uncomment one of the runApp functions inside a main function.
DO NOT REMOVE COMMENTS FROM BOTH OF runApp FUNCTIONS!
